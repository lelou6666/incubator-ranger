# Mapping from Atlas hive cluster-name to Ranger service-name
# this needs to be in format clusterName,componentType,serviceName;clusterName2,componentType2,serviceName2
# Note that there are no blanks anywhere in the value-string
#
# For Hive, the notifications from Atlas include the name of the entities in the following format:
#    dbName@clusterName
#    dbName.tblName@clusterName
#    dbName.tblName.colName@clusterName

# Ranger-tagsync needs to derive the name of the Hive service (in Ranger) from the above entity names.
# By default, Ranger computes Hive service name as: clusterName + â€œ_hive".

# following property to enable Ranger-tagsync to derive the correct Hive service name.
